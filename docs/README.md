# Project 1: 
## [Sarcasm Detection](https://github.com/botvyns/sarcasm_detection_traditional_ML) in Ukrainian Language

This project explores sarcasm detection in the Ukrainian language using three traditional ML classifiers: Random Forest, Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes, and Decision Tree. 

### *Note*: 
There is an update on fine-tuning RoBERTa for sarcasm detection in Ukrainian, generation of synthetic sarcastic dataset with OpenAI and annotation of real sarcastic data with OpenAI. See [this repo](https://github.com/botvyns/sarcasm_detection_ukr). More updates soon.
